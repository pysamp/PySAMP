    Player Objects are almost same as normal objects, except for that they

    Situations you can consider objects like these, are to preview things for
    a player, maybe while they are adjusting said thing. Could be used for
    custom gate systems, where you only want the player to see what they are
    working on. Or race in systems if you want to show an object for a player
    in a checkpoint or so.

    If you are looking to attach an object to a player, have a look at
    :meth:`pysamp.player.Player.set_attached_object`

    In order to create a new player object, please use :meth:`~create`.
